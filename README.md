README

This is Itemize, an effective shopping tool that helps users track the nearest store carrying the product/s they need at that instance of time and offering them the best solutions (cost comparisions, location references, etc.) 

The application is available under the 'Tech' package (Tech -> TechTogether -> src). The 'View' folder consists of the UI and the 'Database' folder consists of the MySQL Database developed in Java. 

The package also consists of a 'Model' package. This gives us manual access to the data, mainly used for testing purposes (we have access to methods such as getName() that returns the name of the item).
